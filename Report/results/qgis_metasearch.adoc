=== QGIS MetaSearch Plugin

During the code sprint, developers from OSGeo, Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) and GeoCat BV worked on an enhancement to the QGIS MetaSearch plugin to improve support for OGC API - Records. MetaSearch is a core plugin that enables QGIS to act as a client application for interacting with metadata catalogue services. A screenshot of the search dialog window of the QGIS MetaSearch plugin is shown in <<img_metasearch1>>.

As a result of the work done during the code sprint, QGIS MetaSearch now supports both OGC CSW and OGC API - Records.  The functionality is currently in a development branch and will be added to the primary branch of QGIS in fall 2021.
