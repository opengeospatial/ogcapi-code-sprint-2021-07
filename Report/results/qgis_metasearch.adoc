=== QGIS MetaSearch Plugin

During the code sprint, developers from OSGeo, MSC and GeoCat BV worked on an enhancement to the QGIS MetaSearch plugin to improve support for OGC API - Records. MetaSearch is a core plugin that enables QGIS to act as a client application for interacting with metadata catalogue services. A screenshot of the search dialog window of the QGIS MetaSearch plugin is shown in <<img_metasearch1>>.

As a result, QGIS Metasearch supports both OGC CSW and OGC API - Records.  The functionality is currently
in a development branch and will be added to QGIS master branch in fall 2021.
