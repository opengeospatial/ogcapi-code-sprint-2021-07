=== CubeWerx CubeSERV

The CubeWerx server ("CubeSERV") supports a wide variety of back-ends including Oracle Database, MariaDB, Shapefiles, etc. It also supports a wide array of service-dependent output formats (e.g. GML, GeoJSON, Mapbox Vector Tiles, MapMP, etc.) and coordinate reference systems. During this code sprint, CubeWerx helped fine-tune and mature several aspects of the OGC API specifications in focus for the sprint, and refined CubeSERV accordingly. CubeSERV supports multiple OGC API specifications.

The CubeSERV implementation of OGC API - Processes was configured to demonstrate a Ship Detection capability, identifying ships from https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/radarsat2/Default.asp[RADARSAT] imagery. This was achieved by executing the analytical process on multiple nodes running in different Public Cloud regions (i.e. one in North America and another in Europe). <<img_cubewerx1>> shows a view of the different nodes, running in different Cloud regions and used to detect the ships. The different nodes communicated through interfaces that conform to OGC API - Processes.

Once a processing job running in CubeSERV has completed the outputs are made available for display on a web portal. In the case of Ship Detection, the location of ships was displayed as shown in <<img_cubewerx2>>.

The CubeSERV implementation of OGC API - Records was configured to support discussion and validation of the specification, whereas the OGC API - Coverages implementation facilitated development of  compliance tests during the code sprint.
