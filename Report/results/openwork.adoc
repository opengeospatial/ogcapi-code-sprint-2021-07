=== Mappings between ISO 19115-3 and OGC API - Records Queryables

Developers from OpenWork took part in the code sprint, with focus on metadata and the https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch[OpenSearch Syndication Protocol] cite:[dewitt_opensearch]. The work on metadata involved designing mappings between the 'queryables' model implemented by OGC API - Records and https://www.iso.org/standard/32579.html[ISO/TS 19115-3:2016], an integrated XML implementation of the metadata standards ISO 19115‑1, ISO 19115‑2, and concepts from ISO/TS 19139. For this code sprint the mappings focused on associations between OGC API - Records and ISO 19115‑1 metadata elements. The mappings have been archived on the sprint's https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-code-sprint-2021-07/blob/main/mappings/ISO19115-3_Mappings.md[GitHub repository] and are presented in <<annex_mappings>>.

=== OpenSearch Syndication Protocol

Some of the prototyping by developers from OpenWork involved implementation of an OpenSearch description document. The OpenSearch description document is used to describe a search engine so that it can be used by search client applications. Once configured on an OpenSearch client (ideally a web browser), the search engine becomes accessible as illustrated on <<img_openwork1>>.
